          Myles Munroe, OBE (20 April 1954 - 9 November 2014) was a Bahamian
          evangelist and ordained pastor who created and directed the Bahamas
          Faith Ministries International (BFMI) and Myles Munroe International.
          He was also an author, lecturer, and leadership consultant. He was the
          president of the International Leadership Training Institute and the
          chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the International
          Third World Leaders Association, as well as the author of numerous
          books. On November 9, 2014, Munroe and his wife died in a plane crash.
          Officials from the Bahamas said their plane collided with a crane at a
          shipyard near Grand Bahama International Airport.
